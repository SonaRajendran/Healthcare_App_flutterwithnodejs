# TODO: Fix Appointment Loading Error

## Summary
Fixed the "TypeError: null: type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'String'" error that occurred when loading appointments from the backend.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a mismatch between the JSON field names returned by the backend API and the field names expected by the Flutter app's Appointment.fromJson factory constructor.

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Updated Appointment.fromJson (medical_healthcare_app/lib/models/appointment.dart)
- Changed `json['date']` to `json['appointment_date']` to match backend response
- Changed `json['time']` to `json['appointment_time']` to match backend response
- This ensures the correct fields are accessed from the backend JSON response

### ✅ 2. Updated Doctor Model (medical_healthcare_app/lib/models/doctor.dart)
- Made `experience`, `bio`, and `availableTime` fields nullable (String?) to match database schema
- Updated constructor parameters to reflect nullable fields
- This prevents null assignment errors when backend returns null values for these optional fields

### ✅ 3. Fixed Doctor Card Widget (medical_healthcare_app/lib/widgets/doctor_card.dart)
- Added null check for `doctor.experience` with fallback to 'N/A'
- Prevents runtime error when experience field is null

### ✅ 4. Fixed Doctor Detail Screen (medical_healthcare_app/lib/screens/doctor_detail_screen.dart)
- Added null checks for `doctor.experience` with fallback to 'N/A'
- Added null checks for `doctor.bio` with fallback to 'No bio available.'
- Added null checks for `doctor.availableTime` with fallback to 'Not specified'
- Prevents runtime errors when these optional fields are null

## Testing
- All compilation errors have been resolved
- The app should now properly handle null values from the backend
- Appointments should load successfully without the "Null is not a subtype of type 'String'" error

## Next Steps
- Test the app by running it and navigating to the appointments screen
- Verify that appointments load correctly from the backend
- Check that doctor details display properly even when some fields are null
